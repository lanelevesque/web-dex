This repo contains 2 packages, one for the front end with React + TypeScript, and one for the backend running Node + ExpressJS.

To run locally, please clone the repo.

```
https://github.com/lanelevesque/web-dex.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to your new web-dex directory.

```
cd web-dex
```

We will now run a local dev instance of the react front end.

```
cd react-pokedex
npm install
npm run dev
```

The front end is now accessible at: http://localhost:5173/

Now, we will run the backend locally.

Open a new terminal window & navigate back to the web-dex directory.

Now, run the following commands.

```
cd express-pokedex
npm install
npm start
```

The backend is now running and available at http://127.0.0.1:3000
